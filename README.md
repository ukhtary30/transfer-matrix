# Tranafer Matrix method for mirror geometry

This is the repository for transfer matrix calculation of one of my paper: [Significant enhancement of light absorption in undoped graphene using dielectric multilayer system](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.5012604) , S. A. Nulli, **M. S. Ukhtary**, R. Saito, Appl. Phys. Lett. 112, 073101 (2018).

The summary of this paper is given by the following link of my webpages: [Cerita Riset](https://ukhtary30.github.io/significant.html)

The main unit of the program is the calculation of the absorption probability and electric field by using transfer matrix. The
